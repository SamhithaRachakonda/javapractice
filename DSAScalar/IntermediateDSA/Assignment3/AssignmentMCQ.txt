Q4. Time Complexity - Arrays
What is the time complexity for inserting/deleting at the beginning of the array?

A). O(1)
B). O(N)
C). O(logN)
D). O(N^2)

Answer: O(N)
Since the element is added or deleted at the beginning of the array => either the remaining elements indexes are shifted by 1 to the right or left. 
If we have N elements in the array, it takes O(N) to complete the task.

What will be the output of the following code?

    class Main {
        static void fun(int[]arr) {
            arr[3] = 98;
            return;
        }

        public static void main(String args[]) {
            int[]arr = {10,20,30,40,50};
            fun(arr);
            System.out.println(arr[3]);
        }
    }

A). 40
B). 30
C). 98
D). Error

Answer: 98
Since the array value is updated in the func method and the arrays are point of reference arrays, so the value at arr[3] gets updated to 98.
