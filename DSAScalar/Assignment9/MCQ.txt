Q3. Time Complexity-ii
What is the time complexity of the following code snippet?

    ArrayList v = new ArrayList();
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
        v.add(i);
    }
    Collections.sort(v);

A). O(n)
B). O(nlogn)
C). O(1)
D). O(n^2)
E). None of the above.

Answer: O(nlogn)
When asked for the time complexity, always answer the worst time complexity, unless specified.
In the above code, using an Arraylist, the elements are added into it in ascending order (Already sorted data). => Time complexity taken here = O(n)
Then used collections to sort the data which takes the worst case time complexity as O(nlogn)

Total time complexity = O(n) + O(nlogn) = O(n).
