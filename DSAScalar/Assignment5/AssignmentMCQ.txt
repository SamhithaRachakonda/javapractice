Q1. Find all the subarrays
Given A = [1, -2, 5, 2, -1, 6]. Choose all the valid subarrays of the array.

A). [5, 2, -1]
B). [-2, -1, 6]
C). [1, -2, 5, 2]
D). [6]

Answer: A, C, D
A subarray is a contiguous part of the array from a given starting index to ending index.
A, C, D options has the elements provided in a continuous manner without any discontinuity.
Option B has discontinuity as -2 is at index 1 and -1, 6 are at indices 4, 5.

Q3. Total Number of Subarrays
Given an array of size 21, find the total number of subarrays of the array.

A). 254
B). 231
C). 369
D). 441

Answer: B
Total number of sub arrays in a given array follows the formula: N*(N+1)/2 
    where, N is the size of the given array.
For 21 size array, total subarrays = 21*22/2
